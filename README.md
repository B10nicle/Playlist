# Playlist

Hello there! Thank you for spending your time and hope you enjoy this project as well as I am.

This is my small project to practice some Java stuff. The main purpose was to create a list of Songs (literally) and play with it.

The main feature is to sort songs as objects.

The next version should probably be able to parse some data from music providers in the following order: song/title/duration. This is what I am to right now.

Currently I have some basic logic and tests.

Cheers and may the force be with you!
